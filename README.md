### I can no longer afford a webhosting service and domain name so everything will be moved to github which is hosted for free. However, due to this limited webhosting, the speed of website is significantly low and will not be as smooth as before (sometimes you can't even load the page) and there will not be as many animations (no more waving video :(( ).  (I have tried to remove some animations but the bugs and errors may still exists, sorry for the inconvenience!).
